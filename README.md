# Scrimba - The Frontend Developer Carrer Path - Module 3 - Scoreboard project

Hello and welcome! Thank you for stopping by.ü§†

This is a solution to the Scoreboard projects from _Module 3 - JavaScript challenges - part 1 chapter_ of the [The Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

The project was originally designed for basketball, but I adapted it for rugby game.

**For you, who doesn't know rules of rugby:**

- In rugby 5 points are scored when you score a try.
- 2 points are scored when kicking the points after the try. So a try and conversion kick is worth a total of 7 points.
- 3 points are scored by kicking a field goal.

## Overview

### The project

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS var() functions
- CSS font-face rule
- CSS hover pseudo-class
- CSS utility classes
- Vanilla JavaScript
  - Onclick events
  - Functions
  - getElementById method
  - textContent property
- Flexbox

### What I learned

On this project, I reviewed the knowledge of HTML and CSS from earlier modules and the basics of JavaScript from the previous chapter.

Five points button:

```html
<button class="points timer-font round-border" onclick="homePlusFivePoints()">
  +5
</button>
```

```css
.points:hover {
  color: var(--dark-blue);
  background: var(--light-purple);
  border: 2px solid var(--dark-blue);
}
```

```js
let homeEl = document.getElementById("home-el");

function homePlusFivePoints() {
  homePoints += 5;
  homeEl.textContent = homePoints;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to follow my learning plan [The Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), deepening my knowledge of HTML/CSS and JS on individual projects that I will share on GitHub.
